# Quick Start Guide: Multimodal Assignment Grading System

## What You Have

You now have a complete shell-based orchestration system for automated multimodal grading. Here's what each file does:

### Core System Files

1. **grade_submissions.sh** - The master orchestration script
   - Discovers and validates student submissions
   - Coordinates the entire grading pipeline
   - Manages parallel processing, error handling, and logging
   - Calls Python modules for specialized tasks

2. **extract_content.py** - Content extraction module
   - Parses HTML, CSS, and images from student work
   - Analyzes semantic structure and accessibility
   - Prepares content for AI model consumption
   - Generates structured JSON output

3. **config_template.env** - Configuration template
   - API credentials and endpoints
   - Processing parameters
   - Feature flags and options
   - Rubric and evaluation settings

4. **setup.sh** - Initial setup script
   - Creates required directory structure
   - Initializes configuration files
   - Checks dependencies
   - Creates sample submission for testing

5. **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation
   - Complete system overview
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Academic references

## Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Run Setup

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This creates all necessary directories and checks your Python environment.

### Step 2: Configure API Access

Edit `config/grading_config.env` and add your API credentials:

```bash
nano config/grading_config.env
```

Minimally required:
- `AI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"`
- `AI_MODEL_VERSION="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"`

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 html5lib pillow tinycss2
```

Or if using virtual environments:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install beautifulsoup4 html5lib pillow tinycss2
```

### Step 4: Test with Dry Run

```bash
./grade_submissions.sh --dry-run --verbose
```

This processes the sample submission without making API calls, allowing you to verify the pipeline works correctly.

### Step 5: Add Real Submissions

Place student work in the submissions directory:

```
submissions/
├── student_001/
│   └── index.html
├── student_002/
│   └── index.html
└── student_003/
    └── index.html
```

### Step 6: Process Submissions

```bash
./grade_submissions.sh
```

Or with options:

```bash
./grade_submissions.sh --parallel --max-concurrent 4 --verbose
```

## Understanding the Shell Script Structure

The shell script implements a modular pipeline architecture following Unix philosophy (Raymond, 2003):

### Key Functions in grade_submissions.sh

**Initialization Functions:**
- `initialize_environment()` - Creates directories, loads config, validates environment
- `parse_arguments()` - Handles command-line options

**Discovery and Validation:**
- `discover_submissions()` - Finds all student directories
- `validate_submission()` - Checks that submissions contain required content

**Processing Pipeline:**
- `extract_submission_content()` - Calls Python script to parse HTML/CSS/images
- `grade_submission()` - Sends extracted content to AI model for assessment
- `generate_feedback_report()` - Creates formatted feedback documents

**Orchestration:**
- `process_single_submission()` - Complete pipeline for one student
- `process_all_submissions()` - Iterates through all submissions
- `main()` - Entry point that coordinates everything

### Shell Script Design Principles

1. **Error Handling**: `set -euo pipefail` causes the script to exit on any error, undefined variable, or pipe failure

2. **Logging**: All operations are logged with timestamps and severity levels to facilitate debugging and auditing

3. **Reproducibility**: Processing metadata records exact model versions, parameters, and timestamps for each grading session (Sandve et al., 2013)

4. **Modularity**: Each function has a single, well-defined responsibility, making the system maintainable and testable

5. **Idempotency**: The script can be safely re-run; it creates directories only if they don't exist and uses timestamps to avoid overwriting outputs

## How the Pipeline Works

### Stage 1: Content Extraction

The shell script calls `extract_content.py` which:

1. Traverses the submission directory recursively
2. Identifies HTML, CSS, image, and other web files
3. Parses HTML using BeautifulSoup (robust HTML5 parsing)
4. Extracts text content, structure, and semantic elements
5. Processes images: resizes large images, converts to base64
6. Analyzes CSS for styling patterns
7. Checks basic accessibility features
8. Outputs structured JSON with all extracted content

**Why separate Python module?** Python provides superior libraries for HTML/CSS/image processing compared to pure bash. The shell script coordinates, while Python handles specialized parsing (Robbins & Beebe, 2005).

### Stage 2: AI Grading (To Be Implemented)

The next development phase involves creating `grade_with_ai.py` which:

1. Reads the extracted content JSON
2. Constructs a multimodal prompt including:
   - Text content from HTML
   - Base64-encoded images
   - Structural information
   - Rubric criteria
3. Makes API call to Claude with vision capabilities
4. Applies multiple evaluation perspectives
5. Parses AI response to extract scores and feedback
6. Structures results as JSON

### Stage 3: Report Generation (To Be Implemented)

Future `generate_report.py` will:

1. Read grading output JSON
2. Create formatted HTML report with:
   - Overall score and summary
   - Perspective-by-perspective breakdown
   - Specific strengths and improvement areas
   - Visual examples from the submission
3. Optionally convert to PDF
4. Apply branding/template styling

## Customization Points

### 1. Evaluation Perspectives

In `config/grading_config.env`:

```bash
EVALUATION_PERSPECTIVES="content,design,technical,accessibility,creativity"
```

Each perspective triggers a separate analytical pass by the AI model, following principles of multi-trait scoring (Shermis & Burstein, 2013).

### 2. Rubric Definition

Create `config/grading_rubric.json` to specify exact criteria:

```json
{
  "content_quality": {
    "weight": 0.30,
    "criteria": [
      "Completeness of required elements",
      "Clarity of writing",
      "Logical organization"
    ]
  },
  "visual_design": {
    "weight": 0.25,
    "criteria": [...]
  }
}
```

### 3. Prompt Engineering

The AI grading module should be customized to include:

- Your course-specific rubric
- Example assessments (few-shot learning)
- Desired tone and feedback style
- Domain-specific terminology

### 4. Processing Options

Adjust in configuration:

- `PARALLEL_PROCESSING`: Enable/disable concurrent processing
- `MAX_CONCURRENT`: Number of simultaneous submissions to process
- `CONTINUE_ON_ERROR`: Whether to stop or continue if one submission fails
- `SAVE_INTERMEDIATE_FILES`: Keep extraction outputs for debugging

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### Canvas LMS Integration (Future)

The system can be extended to:
1. Download submissions directly from Canvas API
2. Process and grade automatically
3. Upload feedback reports back to Canvas
4. Update gradebook with scores

### Git-Based Submission System

If students submit via Git:
1. Clone each student's repository
2. Point `SUBMISSIONS_DIR` to cloned repos
3. Process as normal

### Batch Processing

For large classes:
1. Use `--parallel` mode
2. Set `MAX_CONCURRENT` based on your system
3. Monitor `logs/` directory for progress
4. Use `--dry-run` first to estimate costs

## Theoretical Foundations

This system implements several key principles from learning analytics and educational technology research:

### 1. Multimodal Assessment (Blikstein & Worsley, 2016)

Traditional automated assessment focuses only on text. This system analyzes multiple modalities—text, images, visual design, code structure—providing more comprehensive evaluation similar to how human instructors assess web design work.

### 2. Multi-Perspective Evaluation (Pardo et al., 2019)

Rather than a single holistic score, the system evaluates from multiple perspectives (content, design, technical implementation, accessibility). This provides more actionable feedback and reflects the multifaceted nature of web design competency.

### 3. Formative Assessment (Wiliam, 2011)

The system prioritizes detailed feedback over simple scoring, supporting student learning rather than merely measuring it. The multi-perspective approach provides specific guidance for improvement.

### 4. Reproducible Research (Sandve et al., 2013)

All processing steps, model versions, and parameters are logged. This allows grading decisions to be audited, justified, and replicated—essential for educational fairness.

## Extending the System

### Adding Video Assessment

Future enhancement could add video analysis:

1. Extract frames from video submissions
2. Transcribe audio content
3. Analyze visual composition over time
4. Assess narrative structure

### Peer Comparison

Compare submissions to identify:
- Outliers requiring manual review
- Consistency in grading
- Distribution of scores across class

### Longitudinal Tracking

Track individual students across assignments:
- Measure improvement over time
- Identify persistent weaknesses
- Adapt feedback based on history

### Interactive Dashboard

Web interface for:
- Viewing all submission grades
- Filtering and sorting results
- Downloading reports
- Re-grading with modified rubrics

## Common Workflows

### Scenario 1: Small Class, First Time

```bash
# Setup
./setup.sh

# Add API key to config
nano config/grading_config.env

# Test with dry run
./grade_submissions.sh --dry-run --verbose

# Grade for real
./grade_submissions.sh --verbose

# Review outputs
ls -la output/reports/
```

### Scenario 2: Large Class, Parallel Processing

```bash
# Check API limits first
# Process in parallel
./grade_submissions.sh --parallel --max-concurrent 8

# Monitor progress in real-time
tail -f logs/grading_run_*.log
```

### Scenario 3: Re-grading with Updated Rubric

```bash
# Modify rubric
nano config/grading_rubric.json

# Re-process (outputs get new timestamps)
./grade_submissions.sh --submissions ./original_submissions
```

### Scenario 4: Debugging a Failed Submission

```bash
# Run extraction only for specific student
python3 scripts/extract_content.py \
    submissions/problematic_student \
    temp/debug_extraction \
    --verbose

# Check the extracted JSON
cat temp/debug_extraction/extracted_content.json
```

## Cost Management

Approximate per-submission costs with Claude Sonnet 4.5:

- **Text-only submission**: $0.03-0.08
- **Submission with 1-3 images**: $0.10-0.20
- **Image-heavy submission**: $0.20-0.40

For a class of 30 students with moderate multimodal content: $3-6 per assignment.

**Cost reduction strategies:**
1. Enable image resizing (reduces tokens significantly)
2. Use lower-cost models for initial drafts
3. Batch multiple perspective evaluations in single API call
4. Cache extracted content to avoid reprocessing

## Security and Privacy

### Student Data Protection

1. **Anonymization**: Use student IDs rather than names in directory structure
2. **Access Control**: Restrict permissions on output directories
3. **Encryption**: Consider encrypting sensitive feedback at rest
4. **Audit Logging**: Track all access to grading results

### API Key Security

1. Never commit `grading_config.env` to version control
2. Use environment variables for production deployments
3. Rotate API keys periodically
4. Monitor API usage for anomalies
